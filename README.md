# Work-Day-Scheduler

This simple work day planner was created to help arrnage your day hourly to ensure that key tasks are being focused on. This application runs in the browser and features  HTML and CSS powered by jQuery

Moment.js gives the user the current time and date in the header section of the application

With this app Ive chosen a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
